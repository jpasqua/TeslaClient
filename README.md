#Tesla Model S Rest API

A Java implementation of the client side interface to the Tesla Model S API documented at:

+	[Tesla Model S REST API](http://docs.timdorr.apiary.io/)
+	[Tesla Model S Remote Access Protocol](http://tinyurl.com/mnjyhbb)

This is unofficial documentation of the Tesla Model S REST API used by the iOS and Android apps. It features functionality to monitor and control the Model S remotely. The documents are updated as new information is found.

This software and documentation do not come from Tesla Motors Inc.

*Be careful* when using this software as it can lock and unlock your car as well as control various functions relating to the charging system, sun roof, lights, horn, and other subsystems of the car.

*Be careful* not to send your login and password to anyone other than Tesla or you are giving away the authentication details required to control your car.

#Disclaimer

Use these programs at your own risk. The authors do not guaranteed the proper functioning of these applications. This code attempts to use the same interfaces used by the official Tesla phone apps. However, it is possible that use of this code may cause unexpected damage for which nobody but you are responsible. Use of these functions can change the settings on your car and may have negative consequences such as (but not limited to) unlocking the doors, opening the sun roof, or reducing the available charge in the battery.

#Preparing your build environment

This project assumes a directory structure that looks like this:

	Tesla					-- Overall container that may include other Tesla related projects
		TeslaClient			-- This project
			build
			src
	ThirdParty				-- A repository for third party library dependencies
		apache
			commons-codec-1.9
			commons-lang3-3.3
			commons-logging-1.1.3
		geocoder
		google-gson-2.2.4
		resty

The Tesla/TeslaClient directory corresponds to this github project (TeslaClient.git). 

The following commands will create and populate the hierarchy. It assumes that:

+ <code>$DOWNLOAD</code>is the directory where you downloaded the project from github
+ <code>$ROOT</code>is where you want to place the overall hierarchy

Be sure to either set these variables or adapt the commands below:

	cd $ROOT
	mkdir Tesla
	mv $DOWNLOAD/TeslaClient-master Tesla/TeslaClient
	mkdir ThirdParty
	mkdir ThirdParty/apache
	mkdir ThirdParty/geocoder-java
	mkdir ThirdParty/resty

	# Download the apache libraries
	cd ThirdParty/apache
	wget http://www.us.apache.org/dist//commons/codec/binaries/commons-codec-1.9-bin.zip
	unzip commons-codec-1.9-bin.zip

	wget http://www.us.apache.org/dist//commons/lang/binaries/commons-lang3-3.3-bin.zip
	unzip commons-lang3-3.3-bin.zip

	wget http://www.us.apache.org/dist//commons/logging/binaries/commons-logging-1.1.3-bin.zip
	unzip commons-logging-1.1.3-bin.zip
	rm *.zip

	# Download the geocoder library
	cd ../geocoder-java
	curl -s -O http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/geocoder-java/geocoder-java/0.15/geocoder-java-0.15.jar

	# Download the gson library
	cd ..
	curl -s -O http://google-gson.googlecode.com/files/google-gson-2.2.4-release.zip
	unzip google-gson-2.2.4-release.zip
	rm google-gson-2.2.4-release.zip

	# Download the resty library
	cd resty
	curl -s -O http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/us/monoid/web/resty/0.3.2/resty-0.3.2.jar
	cd ..

	# Create the library
	cd Tesla/TeslaClient
	ant

#Tests and Samples
There are two test programs included in the project: <code>BasicTest</code> and <code>Interactive</code>. The former simply runs through a sequence of functions in the client library to demonstrate that it is connecting and working. The second presents an interactive shell that allows the user to issue the various commands that are available through the client library.

To use either of these programs you must have active credentials for a Tesla vehicle that has remote access enabled. If you have more than one vehicle, you may select which vehicle to use in the Interactive program. BasicTest will always use the first vehicle returned by the Tesla portal.
